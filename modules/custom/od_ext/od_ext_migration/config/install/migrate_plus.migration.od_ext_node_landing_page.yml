      body: |
        <p>Open Maps brings together the Government of Canada’s geospatial
        data, services, and applications for use by Canadians.</p>
        <p>Geospatial data are those that can be linked to a location on a map,
        such as a street address, town, province or any other geographic
        feature such as a coastline, mountain, or river.</p>
        <p>Through this site, Canadians can explore the wealth of geospatial
        data that has been collected by many sources including scientists,
        surveyors, satellites, and marine-based and land-based sensors. It has
        been processed, interpreted, and structured for use in a variety of
        applications.</p>
        <p>Open Maps is the result of the <a href="http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geomatics/canadas-spatial-data-infrastructure/geospatial-communities/federal">
        Federal Geospatial Platform</a> initiative, a multi-year collaborative
        effort of 21 departments and agencies that participate on the
        Government of Canada’s Federal Committee on Geomatics and Earth
        Observations. The Federal Geospatial Platform seeks to fundamentally
        change the way geospatial data are managed, shared, and used by the
        Government of Canada.</p>
        <p>The geospatial data and services found in Open Maps are made
        available under the <a href="[site:url]/open-government-licence-canada">
        Open Government Licence</a>, and can be used to support your research,
        application development, or other purposes as allowed under the
        licence.</p>

      body: "<p>On October 21, 2005, the Government announced its commitment to\nproactively disclose the awarding of grants and contributions over\n$25,000 as part of its Management Improvement Agenda.</p>\n\n<p>The rules and principles governing government grants and\ncontributions are outlined in the Treasury Board\n<a href=\"http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525\">\nPolicy on Transfer Payments</a>. Transfer payments are transfers of\nmoney, goods, services or assets made from an appropriation to\nindividuals, organizations or other levels of government, without the\nfederal government directly receiving goods or services in return,\nbut which may require the recipient to provide a report or other\ninformation subsequent to receiving payment. These expenditures are\nreported in the\n<a href=\"http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/txt/72-eng.html\">\nPublic Accounts of Canada</a>. The major types of transfer payments are\ngrants, contributions and 'other transfer payments'.</p>\n\n<p>Included in this category, but not to be reported under proactive\ndisclosure of awards, are (1) transfers to other levels of government\nsuch as Equalization payments as well as Canada Health and Social\nTransfer payments. (2) Grants and contributions reallocated or\notherwise redistributed by the recipient to third parties; and (3)\ninformation that would normally be withheld under the\n<a href=\"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/index.html\">\n<em>Access to Information Act</em></a> and the\n<a href=\"http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html\">\n<em>Privacy Act</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/432527ab-7aac-45b5-81d6-7597107a7013\">\nDownload datasets of the Proactive Disclosure - Grants and\nContributions</a>.</p>\n"

        <p>The Open by Default pilot is your backstage pass to the work of four
        government departments: Canadian Heritage, Environment and Climate
        Change Canada, Natural Resources Canada and Treasury Board of Canada
        Secretariat. The goal is to give you a snapshot of Government of Canada
        documents as they’re being created. The Government of Canada works for
        Canadians, so we believe you should know what we’re doing
        behind-the-scenes.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>It is time to shine more light on government to ensure it remains
        focused on the people it serves. Government and its information should
        be open by default.</p>
        <footer>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</footer></blockquote>
        <h2>Why was the Open by Default pilot created?</h2>
        <p>The Open by Default pilot demonstrates proactive release of working
        information which supports government transparency and accountability.
        This pilot will help us clear the path as we maximize the ongoing
        release of information across government.</p>
        <h2>What kind of documents can be found using the Open by Default
        pilot?</h2>
        <p>Documents available through the Open by Default Pilot are snapshots
        of works-in-progress from Government of Canada public servants, shared
        for your exploration. These can include field notes, research
        documents, reporting documents and organizational charts from any of
        the four participating government departments.</p>
        <h2>Who is participating in the Open by Default pilot, and why?</h2>
        <p>Four government departments are offering documents for the pilot:
          Canadian Heritage, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Natural
           Resources Canada, and Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. These
           departments are participating in order to provide a sample of the
           government’s scientific and cultural research to public researchers,
           businesses and curious citizens. We are expanding our efforts at
           opening data and information to pursue goals with Canadians
           cooperatively, whether you’re a professor, a student, public
           servant, or engaged citizen. The Government of Canada would like to
           thank the Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation (CSTMC)
           for its help in developing the Open by Default pilot. In February
           2016, the CSTMC launched its own open by default portal, called
           <a href="https://documents.techno-science.ca/en/index.htm">Open
           Heritage</a>.</p>
        <h2>How can you use the Open by Default pilot?</h2>
        <p>This pilot provides direct access to working documents that we hope
        will provide insight into the work your government is doing and lead to
        greater collaboration. For example, let’s say you’re a university
        professor researching climate change. You’re browsing Open by Default
        and discover an interesting document owned by Environment and Climate
        Change Canada (ECCC). You connect with a Government of Canada
        researcher and share information with one another. From this
        interaction, you receive an expanded research package that you can
        share with other academics and ECCC has received more information they
        can include in their own research.</p>
        <p>The most important part of this pilot is you. Have a look backstage,
        discover a new way to connect with your government and
        <a href="[site:url]/forms/contact-us">contact us</a> to let us know what
        you think.</p>
        <p>For more information on re-using information released by the Open by
        Default pilot, please refer to Canada’s
        <a href="[site:url]/open-government-licence-canada">Open Government
        Licence</a>.</p>

        <h2>About the Consultation</h2>
        <p>The Government of Canada champions the principles of openness and
        transparency. By increasing the availability of government information
        and engaging the public, we can build a stronger country – one that is
        more innovative, more informed, more participatory, and full of
        economic opportunity.</p>
        <p>In 2012, Canada joined the Open Government Partnership (OGP) to
        improve the quality of the programs and services that citizens receive.
        As we near the end of our first two years as a member of the
        Open Government Partnership, it is time to engage with Canadians on the
        development of Canada's Action Plan on Open Government Consultation
        (CAPOG) 2.0.</p>
        <p>Our goal is a rich and productive dialogue on how to ensure Action
        Plan 2.0 builds on the successes and lessons of the last two years.</p>
        <p>We are asking for your input on how to best meet these consultation
        goals and increase participation.</p>
        <p>Please have a look at the <a href="/en/consultations/open-government-action-plan-20-consultation">

      title: 'Mid-Term Self-Assessment Report on Canada''s Action Plan on Open Government 2014-16'
      language: en
      body: |
        <section>
          <h2>Mid-term Self-assessment Report (<time datetime="2016-01">January
          2016</time>)</h2>
          <p>The Government of Canada has committed to leading the efforts in
          accelerating and expanding open data in order to strengthen openness,
          and accountability to government. It is striving to set a higher bar
          for transparency, recognizing that government and its information
          should be open by default. As this report demonstrates, Canada’s open
          government commitment is shared across federal departments and
          agencies.</p>
          <p>Canada’s National Action Plan on Open Government is renewed every
          two years to ensure we are on track towards greater openness,
          transparency and efficiency.&nbsp; As part of Canada’s commitment to
          the Open Government Partnership, the Government of Canada summarizes
          progress at the mid-way point of each Action Plan. For Action Plan
          2014-2016, this report is Canada’s mid-term assessment of how it is
          progressing on commitments so far. The Government of Canada is
          already planning ahead for the third national Open Government plan,
          to be launched this summer.</p>
          <p>As the Government of Canada develops the next Open Government
          plan, it will consult broadly, seeking the views of a wide range of
          individuals and organizations that have perspectives to share. While
          final commitments will be arrived at with extensive public
          engagement, Canada does anticipate accelerating and expanding open
          data initiatives so that Canadians can easily access and use their
          data. Canada also expects to enhance the openness of government
          overall, including a review of the <em>Access to Information
          Act.</em></p>

          <h2>1. Introduction and Background</h2>
          <p><a href=
          "http://open.canada.ca/en/content/canadas-action-plan-open-government-2014-16">
          Canada’s Action Plan on Open Government 2014-16</a> is made up of 12
          commitments to advance open government along three streams of
          activity: Open Data, Open Information, and Open Dialogue. This is
          Canada’s second national action plan in support of its membership in
          the international <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open
          Government Partnership (OGP),</a> which it joined in April
          2012.&nbsp; More than 50 deliverables and activities were to be
          implemented between <time datetime="2014-07-01">July 1, 2014</time>
          and <time datetime="2016-06-30">June 30, 2016</time> under the Action
          Plan commitments.</p>
          <p>The commitments in the plan highlight the principles of
          transparency, civic participation, public accountability, and access
          to new technologies for openness and accountability. Commitments
          focus on improvements in four of the five Grand Challenge areas
          identified by the OGP:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>improving public services;</li>
            <li>increasing public integrity;</li>
            <li>more effectively managing public resources; and,</li>
            <li>increasing corporate accountability (see Annex).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As Canada marks the end of Year 1 of this Action Plan’s two-year
          time frame, this report provides a mid-term self-assessment of open
          government commitment progress to date. It outlines how the Action
          Plan was developed, assesses progress to date, and defines next steps
          for each commitment. The report also shows how Action Plan 2014-2016
          commitments reflect the feedback received from the Independent
          Reporting Mechanism (IRM) on Canada’s first Action Plan and open
          government activities undertaken over the last year in addition to
          what was outlined in the Action Plan.</p>

          <h2>2. Action Plan Development Process</h2>
          <p>In <time datetime="2014-04">April 2014</time>, the Treasury Board
          of Canada Secretariat (TBS) conducted consultations to support the
          development of Canada’s second Action Plan.&nbsp; Building on lessons
          learned in the development of the first plan in 2012, an inclusive
          approach engaged citizens, civil society organizations, government
          departments and agencies, academics, and the private sector
          throughout the development process.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Over a six-month period, Canadians across the country were invited
          to participate in online and in-person consultation events to explore
          potential open government activities, refine them into a set of
          ambitious commitments, and define concrete actions for each.&nbsp; As
          a final step, a full draft of the Action Plan was posted online for
          public review and comment. Additional detail on the various phases of
          this consultation can be found in the <a href=
          "http://open.canada.ca/en/content/canadas-action-plan-open-government-2014-16">
          Action Plan</a> and in a <a href=
          "http://open.canada.ca/en/consultations/what-we-heard-summary-report">
          “What We Heard” summary report</a> published in <time datetime=
          "2014-11">November 2014</time>.</p>
          <p>By engaging the public in a way that provided several options for
          participation, TBS received valuable feedback. Many of these ideas
          made it into the Action Plan for 2014-2016. Canadians shared three
          key priorities:</p>
          <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
            <li><strong>Make consultation opportunities available with more
            notice:</strong> Before stakeholders, <strong></strong>citizens,
            and civil society organizations were consulted, all Canadians were
            given the opportunity to review the proposed consultation plan on
            the Government of Canada’s Open Government Portal.&nbsp; This
            helped raise awareness of all planned consultation activities, and
            provided advance notice of online and in-person opportunities to
            participate in the development of the Action Plan. Canadians were
            asked to share ideas on how to encourage public input into the
            development of the Action Plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Make participation easier:</strong> In addition to
            engaging via the Web and social media throughout the process,
            citizens and civil society organizations participated in a series
            of public workshops, discussion panels, and other in-person events
            in communities across the country.&nbsp; Together, they
            brainstormed new open government commitments, and set out what
            could be accomplished within the two-year time frame of the Action
            Plan.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>&nbsp;Publish results and responses:</strong> An overview
              of these consultations was posted in a <a href=
              "http://open.canada.ca/en/consultations/what-we-heard-summary-report">
              “What We Heard” Summary Report</a> in <time datetime=
              "2014-11">November 2014</time>. This report outlined the
              consultation approach, as well as the comments, ideas, and
              suggestions from Canadians that helped shaped the Action
              Plan.&nbsp; <a href=
              "/data/en/dataset/74aa0e1a-8e13-4ddb-a31e-129c253a09b3">Open
              Government Action Plan Consultation Data</a> was also made
              available as an open dataset of all feedback received.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Consultation on progress at the half-way point:</strong>
          This assessment benefited from input received through a four-week
          online consultation that invited Canadians and stakeholders including
          civil society, academia, the private sector and others to share their
          views on Canada’s progress in completing Year 1 deliverables under
          the Action Plan. Participation in this consultation was lower than
          anticipated. Canada recognizes that it must continue to take steps to
          increase public awareness of both Canada’s Action Plan on Open
          Government, and of the opportunities for Canadians and other
          stakeholders to provide feedback and direction on the Plan.</p>
          <p>A draft of Canada’s self-assessment report was shared online for
          public review, comments, and input. Additional feedback is still
          welcome on the self-assessment report, and on the open.canada.ca site
          as a whole.</p>

          <h2>3. Responding to IRM Recommendations</h2>
          <p>In early 2014, the OGP’s Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM)
          published its <a href=
          "http://www.opengovpartnership.org/files/canadafinal2012engpdf/download">
          Canada Progress Report 2012-13</a> on the implementation of Canada’s
          first Action Plan, and made recommendations for improvements to
          several of Canada’s open government activities.&nbsp; The IRM’s
          findings and observations helped to identify and refine many of the
          commitments in Canada’s second Action Plan:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Improve public consultation and citizen
            engagement:</strong> As a direct result of the IRM’s findings,
            Canada worked to improve consultation and engagement with
            Canadians. For the development of the second action plan, the
            Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat engaged early and often,
            online and in-person with individuals, organizations, academics,
            and the business world. The government also initiated a number of
            activities to improve public consultation and citizen engagement
            beyond the borders of Open Government by establishing principles,
            best practices, and whole-of-government approaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Make specific and ambitious commitments:</strong> For
            each of the 12 commitments, specific deliverables were set out
            within the period of this Action Plan.&nbsp; The plan has become
            more specific, as Canada has included commitments that focus on
            concrete, timed deliverables. With the focus on government-wide
            activities, policies, and solutions, the development of national
            standards, and support for international open government
            initiatives, this plan builds on the first Action Plan.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improve information flow (Access to
              Information):</strong> Canada has begun modernizing the
              administration of its Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP)
              Programs across the government. In addition to improvements to
              ATIP administration under the current Action Plan (searchable
              summaries of <a href=
              "http://open.canada.ca/en/search/ati">completed Access to
              Information requests</a>, the ability to make <a href=
              "https://atip-aiprp.apps.gc.ca/atip/welcome.do?lang=en">online
              ATIP requests</a>, and enhancements to ATIP training for public
              servants), a number of other important steps are being taken. For
              instance, the Open Information portal now provides single-window
              access to proactively disclosed information on contracts, travel,
              and hospitality expenditures.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Focus on open government, not just open data:</strong>
            While open data remained a critical component of Canada’s open
            government strategy, Canada expanded commitments related to
            government integrity and accountability in the current Action
            Plan.&nbsp; This includes open contracting, making budget and
            expenditure information open and accessible, and introducing
            legislation that requires mandatory reporting on extractives.</li>
            <li><strong>Standardize information and data and make it more
            usable:</strong> Canada has improved search and discovery of
            Government of Canada information and data by standardizing the
            format to make it reusable, improve access to it and to help users
            find relevance in the data. Data and metadata are now standardized
            to ensure the information assets are relatable; allowing users to
            find what they need, use it, and have the data make sense to be
            able to use it with data from other sources.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Whole-of-government support:</strong> The <a href=
              "http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108">Directive on
              Open Government</a>, a recently-launched whole-of-government
              policy directive, will maximize Canadians’ access to government
              data and information and prompt a cultural shift to “Open by
              Default” across government.&nbsp; The <a href=
              "http://www.clerk.gc.ca/eng/feature.asp?pageId=349#VI">Blueprint
              2020 Vision</a> for the future of the federal public service, a
              complementary initiative, includes creating an open and networked
              environment that engages citizens and partners for the public
              good.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The observations and recommendations of this independent
          assessment of Canada’s open government activities have helped to make
          the plans more concrete and the open government activities more
          successful.</p>

          <h2>5. Peer Exchange and Learning</h2>
          <p>Canada welcomes every opportunity to share experiences and lessons
          learned in implementing open government initiatives with fellow OGP
          members and other countries.&nbsp; In fact, Canada’s activities have
          benefited considerably from leveraging the best practices of other
          countries. Recent examples of peer-exchange activities with the
          international open government community include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>OGP Open Data Working Group:</strong> Canada’s
              co-leadership of the <a href=
              "http://www.opengovpartnership.org/groups/opendata/">OGP Open
              Data Working Group</a> along with its civil society partner, the
              Web Foundation, has supported seven OGP member countries to
              define ambitious open data commitments for their national action
              plans.&nbsp; Through work in the streams of Principles,
              Measurement, Standards and Capacity Building, this group has
              increased awareness of open government data issues, engaging with
              the broader global open data community to share information and
              ideas. The Government of Canada’s co-leadership of the Principles
              stream of activity with the Organization for Economic Cooperation
              and Development (OECD) led to its strong support in the
              development of the International Open Data Charter.

          <h2>6. Open and Transparent Government</h2>
          <p>The Government of Canada is strongly committed to open, honest
          government that is accountable to Canadians. On <time datetime=
          "2015-11-13">November 13, 2015</time>, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
          took the opportunity to <a href=
          "http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2015/11/13/prime-minister-canada-makes-ministerial-mandate-letters-public">
          publicly release</a> all ministerial mandate letters, as part of his
          plan for open and transparent government for Canadians.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In its mandate letters, the government has committed to set a
          higher bar for openness and transparency in government. This includes
          publicly releasing all key information that informs the decisions it
          makes, and to accelerating and expanding open data initiatives. The
          transparency mandate expectations of the government will serve to
          broaden the reach of open government in the plan for the coming two
          years.</p>
          <p>In addition to commitment-specific deliverables highlighted in
          this report, Canada has launched a variety of activities and
          initiatives that embrace the spirit of open government that reflect
          Canada's commitment to integrating the principles of transparency,
          accountability, and civic participation into government programs and
          services.&nbsp; Key examples include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>International Open Data Charter:</strong> Canada, along
              with dozens of governments, civil society organizations and
              international institutions, is leading the charge to develop
              common global principles for open data. The <a href=
              "http://opendatacharter.net/">International Open Data Charter</a>
              provides a set of foundational principles for open data as well
              as an implementation guide to support governments in adopting the
              principles, standards and practices. At the 3<sup>rd</sup>
              International Open Data Conference held in Ottawa on
              <time datetime="2015-05-28">May 28-29, 2015</time>, public
              consultations were launched to gather feedback and comments on
              the draft Charter from the international open data
              community.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li><strong>Geomatics Environmental Scan and Value Study:</strong>
            An independent assessment of the Canadian geomatics sector
            supported by Natural Resources Canada has been completed, as well
            as detailed analysis of the economic and non-economic benefits of
            the use of geospatial technologies and services. In economic terms,
            geospatial technologies contribute some $21 billion of value to
            Canada's Gross Domestic Product, and generate about 19,000 jobs in
            Canada's economy. Although more difficult to measure, the range of
            social and environmental benefits is impressive,&nbsp; encompassing
            improved resource stewardship, better response to disease
            outbreaks, speedier deployment of first responders in emergency
            situations, and coordinated and timely management of physical
            infrastructure.</li>

              communications networks, improved connectivity with others living
              in and outside their countries, and support for citizens'
              monitoring and reporting on human rights violations or political
              repression.&nbsp; This project's activities will help to increase
              political accountability and transparency.

          <h2>7. Conclusion and Next Steps</h2>
          <p>Open Government continues to drive change. Canada has made
          significant progress on the implementation of its second Action Plan
          on Open Government, although there is still much to be done over the
          coming year to deliver on commitments to Canadians.</p>
          <p>To make sure that citizens and stakeholders can monitor Canada's
          progress on meeting Action Plan commitments, an End-of-Term
          Self-assessment Report will be published later in 2016. While
          developing this final assessment of Canada's Action Plan 2014-2016,
          the government will be able to use the lessons learned as a strong
          foundation for future commitments and activities in developing
          Canada's third Action Plan on Open Government.</p>
          <p>Action Plan 2014-2016 has helped to begin to embed open government
          principles and approaches in the day-to-day work of the public
          service, and to experiment with new and innovative open government
          activities.&nbsp; The Government of Canada is committed to
          accelerating, expanding, and enhancing the government's transparency
          and accountability.</p>

      title: 'Draft for Consultation: Mid-term Self-assessment on Third Biennial Plan to the Open Government Partnership (2016-2018)'
      language: en
      body: |
        <section class="alert alert-info">
        <p>The consultation period on this draft is closed, but we want this to
        be an ongoing dialogue. Please&nbsp;
        <a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/forms/contact-us">contact us</a>&nbsp;
        at any time.</p>
        </section><p>The Government of Canada released its Third Biennial Plan
        to the Open Government Partnership in July 2016. The Plan was
        structured around four priority areas: open by default; fiscal
        transparency, innovation, prosperity and sustainable development; and
        engaging Canadians in the world. Each of the twenty-two commitments in
        the Plan reflects one of these priority areas to advance open
        government. The Plan is being implemented over a two year period
        between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2018.</p>
        <p>At this mid-term point, we are reporting on what we accomplished so
        far, and would like to hear from you on our progress to date. The
        reporting period for this report is July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017.</p>
        <p>In addition to this self-assessment report, and as part of our
        pledge to be more transparent and accountable about our progress on
        commitments, we have developed <a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/content/progress-tracker-third-biennial-plan-open-government-partnership">
        dashboards</a> for each of the 22 commitments in order to report more
        frequently on their status. Although this mid-term self-assessment
        consultation is only open for a fixed period of time, you are
        encouraged to provide your comments and suggestions at any point
        through the life-cycle of this two-year Open Government Plan
        through the dashboards.</p>
        <section><h2>There are two ways you can participate in this
        consultation:</h2>
          <ol><li>Comment on the progress made on individual commitments by
          following the links in the summary table below.</li>
