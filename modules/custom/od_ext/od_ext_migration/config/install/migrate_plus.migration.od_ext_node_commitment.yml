          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Canada was an early adopter of access to information
            legislation, first introducing the Access to Information Act in
            1983. The Access to Information Act maintains openness and
            transparency by serving the important public interest of enabling
            public debate on the conduct of government institutions, in turn
            strengthening the accountability of the Government of Canada to
            Canadians. In recent years, the need to update the Act has been
            noted during open government consultations and by the Information
            Commissioner as well as other stakeholders. It has not been
            significantly updated since 1983.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will move forward on a first round of
            concrete proposals to improve the Access to Information Act,
            informed by the views of Parliament, the Information
            Commissioner, and consultations with Canadians, and will then
            undertake a full review of the Act by no later than 2018.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>
            <p>The Government’s commitments to improve the Act in the near
            term include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Making government data and information open by default, in
              formats that are modern and easy to use;</li>
              <li>Eliminating all fees, except for the initial $5 filing
              fee;</li>
              <li>Providing requestors with a written explanation when
              information cannot be released;</li>
              <li>Giving Government institutions and the Information
              Commissioner authority to decline to process requests that are
              frivolous or vexatious;</li>
              <li>Giving the Information Commissioner the power to order the
              release of government information;</li>
              <li>Ensuring that the Access to Information Act applies
              appropriately to the Prime Minister’s and Ministers’ Offices,
              as well as administrative institutions that support Parliament
              and the courts;</li>
              <li>Undertaking a mandatory legislative review of the Access to
              Information Act every five years; and</li>
              <li>Strengthening performance reporting on the Access to
              Information program.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To make early progress on these commitments, on May 5, 2016
            the Government of Canada issued an Interim Directive on the
            Administration of the Access to Information Act. The Directive
            sends a strong message across federal institutions that
            government information belongs to the people it serves and should
            be open by default. It emphasizes that government information
            should be available to the public, except in very limited and
            specific situations when it must be protected for reasons such as
            privacy, confidentiality, and security. The Directive also
            directs federal officials to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>waive all Access to Information fees apart from the $5
              filing fee; and</li>
              <li>release information in user-friendly formats (e.g.
              spreadsheets), whenever feasible.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Relevance to OGP values</h3>
            <p>This commitment relates to the OGP values of transparency,
            civic participation, and public accountability.</p>

              <li>Introduce legislation to move forward on improvements to
              the Access to Information Act.</li>

              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">On June 19, 2017, the Government
              introduced legislation in the House of Commons to modernize the
              Access to Information Act, expand the scope of the law and make
              more government information open by default (see the <a href=

            a request take longer than 30 days to fulfill, it is proposed
            that the Government will provide a written explanation for the
            delay to the requester and to the Privacy Commissioner.

          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Considerable data can often be trapped inside government
            silos. Meanwhile, open data has the potential to transform how
            government officials make decisions and how citizens interact
            with their government. By providing a range of quality open data
            from reliable sources, Canada supports informed participation and
            engagement in the development and delivery of programs, services,
            and policies by citizens and government workers alike. The
            Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that its data is
            open by default. Data must be discoverable, accessible, and
            reusable without restriction so as to enhance transparency,
            enable better services to Canadians, facilitate innovation, and
            inform public participation.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will increase the quality and
            visibility of federal data holdings and set measurable targets
            for the release of open data over the next five years.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>
            <p>Over the last five years, federal departments and agencies
            have established a good foundation of available open data. The
            Treasury Board Secretariat’s current Directive on Open Government
            requires federal departments to maximize the release of eligible
            government data and publish Open Government Implementation Plans
            outlining how they would implement the Directive’s requirements.
            The current work is seeking to “automate” the opening of data,
            and ingrain the practice throughout all processes.</p>
            <p>The next step is about increasing the diversity, timeliness,
            and quality of data released, to maximize the potential impact of
            the reuse of the Government’s data by Canadians. As an example,
            Statistics Canada is working on increasing access to high-quality
            statistical information in open formats, including releasing all
            2016 Census data a full 10 months sooner than the 2011 Census.
            Steps are also being taken to ensure the data is well understood
            by Canadians.</p>
            <p>In addition, a key focus is being placed on streamlining and
            improving the process by which departments proactively disclose
            information on government spending and human resources online.
            Finally, the Government of Canada is continuing to take advantage
            of opportunities to share best practices and work with data
            experts both nationally and internationally to improve its own
            open data services and support the release of high quality
            data.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>Relevance to OGP values</h3>
            <p>This commitment relates to the OGP value of transparency.</p>

              inventories</a> were published for the first time in March
              2017. With the creation of these inventories, over 1,500 new
              datasets have been identified as eligible for release. In
              addition to having the ability to search through the
              inventories on open.canada.ca, citizens also have the option to
              communicate with the Government by voting on datasets most
              useful to them. This in turn will help departments and agencies
              to fast track the more popular datasets for release based on
              voting. <a href=

                    established in several departments, awareness of open
                    government increased, and it created an opportunity for

                <p>Open.canada.ca was re-launched in October 2016 to improve
                the search and discovery of open data records by developing
                an integrated search with more search filters and enriched
                metadata. This has improved Canadians’ access to data and

                document to provide comprehensive and authoritative direction
                on requirements for publishing open government resources. It
                will include formal guidance on issues such as data quality,

          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>As information becomes increasingly digitized, it brings with
            it a number of challenges including ensuring its findability and
            preservation. As a result, efforts to improve how information can
            be found, used, shared, and preserved are underway. Canada has
            made significant progress on improving public access to
            government data under its last two Action Plans. By improving
            access to other forms of government information and ensuring
            preservation of this information, the Government of Canada can
            promote and maintain informed participation and sound
            decision-making.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will establish government-wide
            initiatives, platforms, and tools to ensure that open information
            is discoverable and accessible for use by future generations.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>The Government of Canada is working to provide
            enhanced, centralized, one-stop access to digital content from
            departments and agencies across government. Guidance is being
            developed to ensure the ongoing preservation of this information
            through the application of consistent standards and practices for
            long-term preservation.

                Open Information Portal</a> was launched as a way to provide
                an enhanced entry point to access to digital content from
                across government. As of June 30th 2017, this collection
                holds 166 Government of Canada information assets.</p>
                <p>In October 2016, the publishing platform,
                registry.open.canada.ca, was relaunched to consolidate the
                publication process for all open government resources. This
                includes, open data, open information, proactive disclosure
                reports, access to information summary reports, and open data
                inventories. Prior to this, there were 3 different publishing
                platforms. This integration enabled a simpler publication
                process as well as the development of a single search on
                open.canada.ca.</p>
                <p>As of June 30, 2017, the Treasury Board of Canada
                Secretariat, in partnership with various departmental
                stakeholders, was in the process of developing an <a href=

                Open by Default Pilot Project</a> to be hosted on

                non-sensitive, federal information in a timely and relevant
                manner. Various types of documents have been identified that
                will be accessible in draft format (i.e., working documents),
                to enable Canadians to observe and comment on programs and

            <h3>Next steps to June 2018</h3>
            <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">The Open Government team at Treasury
              Board of Canada Secretariat will finalize guidance documents
              for publishing open government resources on open.canada.ca
              which will provide departments with better clarity on
              publishing requirements. With this, it is expected that more
              departments will contribute information assets to
              open.canada.ca. Also, as part of the Directive on Open
              Government, Government of Canada departments and agencies will
              be required to complete an open information inventory by
              October 2018. Therefore, by June 2018, the Open Government team
              at the Treasury Board Secretariat will need to develop and
              provide firm guidance on the scope of open information as well
              as the accessibility and official languages requirements for
              new content. Currently, this has been a huge barrier for
              publication, as departments lack resources to translate and
              convert material into accessible formats in order to publish on
              open.canada.ca. The Open Government team will be exploring
              potential tools to assist departments with resolving these
              issues in order to increase the publication rate of open
              information assets on open.canada.ca.</li>
              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">Consultations will be held over the
              summer of 2017 on the guidance document referenced above, that
              will provide comprehensive and authoritative direction on
              requirements for departments when publishing open government
              resources. The document will be finalized and published on
              open.canada.ca later in 2017.</li>
              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">Library and Archives Canada estimates
              that an additional 240,000 pages will be reviewed by June 2018.
              Final policy instruments approval will be sought during the
              fall of 2017. The Directive will be available on Library and
              Archives Canada’s external website and guidelines on removing
              restrictions will be published on GCpedia by the end of this
              fiscal year (i.e., March 2018). The remaining 160,000

                by June 30, 2018. This is approximately another 1.2 million
                pages that will be digitized. Another 45 datasets have been
                identified for release by June 30, 2018.

                <p>Library and Archives Canada’s plan for the coming year is

                updated captures of still-existing .gc.ca sites, and develop
                harvest and quality assurance methodologies for capturing the
                evolving Canada.ca domain. They are also looking at improving
                the indexation process to facilitate timely access.</p>
                <p>Indexation of acquired content since 2015 is yet to be

          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Since open government is a relatively new way of doing things,
            there is no single, common, and agreed-upon methodology to measure
            progress. As Canada defines its goals, it will also have to define
            how it wants to measure them, identifying interim steps towards
            longer term objectives.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will integrate performance indicators
            for openness and transparency into a Performance Management
            Framework for Open Government.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>Gathering data and analyzing on the release of data
            and information will help measure progress on improving openness
            and transparency. Further analysis will be completed as part of the
            development of an overall Performance Management Framework for
            government-wide information management to expand beyond these and
            better measure progress on broader open government efforts.

          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Public servants in the Government of Canada must change how they
            design and deliver programs and services to support Canada’s
            commitments to transparency and public engagement. An openness
            mindset needs to be integrated into day-to-day business activities.
            Open data, for example, is useful not only to those who regularly
            evaluate and use data to support financial, statistical, and
            socio-economic analysis, but also to non-data specialists working
            in policy, operational, and service delivery areas. Sharing and
            leveraging data, information, and technology across the government
            can help innovation flourish.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will support a shift to greater
            transparency and engagement within the public service through Open
            Government learning material and opportunities for public
            servants.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>Individuals working in departments across government
            will have access to learning material to build their skills and
            capabilities for using open data, open information, and open
            dialogue to support better operational and policy decisions.
            Furthermore, to boost the value of available open data to
            Canadians, public servants can be guided to understand how to set
            priorities for data or information publication, based on its
            potential value to users both inside and outside of government.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Relevance to OGP values</h3>
            <p>This commitment relates to the OGP values of transparency, civic
            participation, and accountability.</p>

              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">The Government of Canada has developed a
              Service Strategy. It’s goal is to continually improve the quality

                <ul class="mrgn-bttm-md">
                  <li>ensuring that services are designed and delivered in a
                  way that puts clients’ needs first;</li>
                  <li>making the online service experience so easy that users
                  choose the digital path; and</li>
                  <li>ensuring that services are connected to each other so
                  that the Government can offer a “tell us once” experience, in
                  partnership with other Canadian jurisdictions, to minimize
                  how often Canadians are asked to provide the same
                  information.</li>
                </ul>

          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Canada is a vast country and access for many citizens to
            Canadian Culture and Heritage artefacts can be a challenge.
            Although an increasing proportion of Canadian Culture and Heritage
            artefacts are available in a digitized format, they are on
            individual websites and may still be difficult to find. This opens
            new opportunities to expand the scope and reach of Canadian museums
            and the social and economic benefits they deliver to Canadians.
            Using Linked Open Data approaches, this initiative will link the
            collections across Canadian museums forming a National Inventory of
            Cultural and Heritage Artefacts.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will expand collaboration with its
            provincial, territorial, and municipal partners and key
            stakeholders to develop a searchable National Inventory of Cultural
            and Heritage Artefacts to improve access across museum
            collections.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>In 2015-16, the Canadian Heritage Information Network
            Program partnered with eight art museums across Canada to develop
            an approach to link the collections of each museum with each other,
            and to related external resources, based on industry best practices
            (e.g., Linked Open Data). This work demonstrates the feasibility of
            using Open Data approaches to link collections across museums and
            other memory organizations.<br>
            Building on these results, the Canadian Heritage Information
            Network Program is developing and implementing a multi-year
            business strategy to work with the Culture and Heritage community
            to grow the network of linked collections through the Canadian
            Culture and Heritage Linked Open Data Cloud.

            <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">
                <p>In 2016-17, Canadian Heritage continued work on collecting
                data from four of the institutions involved in the 150 Years of
                Canadian Art project (Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, Art
                Gallery of Ontario, the McCord Museum and the McMichael
                Canadian Art Collection). The domain was expanded beyond
                Canadian art to include objects from more varied collections
                such as Asian art, ethnology and costumes and textiles.
                Canadian Heritage developed a new site called the <a href=
                "http://chin-rcip.canadiana.ca/aclod2/search/artefact">Canadian
                Heritage Information Network Program Linked Data Test
                site</a>.</p>
                <p>As of June 2017, reference points for 14,885 terms from a
                recognized standard (nomenclature) were created, and records
                for 529 institutions, 794 groups (artist groups,
                organizations), and 60,575 persons were developed. These
                authorities will be used in future phases of the project.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">In addition to the reference points
              mentioned above, resource indicators were created for 166,762
              objects. A taxonomy was also implemented as a search assistant,
              and a tabbed interface with multiple access points was
              developed.</li>
              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">As of June 2017, 8 partner museums have
              joined the project: the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, the Art
              Gallery of Nova Scotia, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the McCord
              Museum, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, the Musée des
              beaux arts de Montréal, the National Gallery of Canada, and the
              Vancouver Art Gallery. Select data contributed by these
              institutions has been enhanced with linkages to Linked Open Data
              sources from around the world.</li>

            <h3>Next steps to June 2018</h3>
            <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">Based on lessons learned from the
              project to date, next steps to develop authorities and standards
              this year will include:
                <ul class="mrgn-bttm-md">
                  <li>refining the data model,</li>
                  <li>selection of target ontologies,</li>
                  <li>elaborating a design for maintaining national authorities
                  and linking them to existing global authorities, and</li>
                  <li>continuing to liaise with international bodies with
                  expertise in this area.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The data model will be the most important foundation piece
                to be developed this year.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">The lessons learned from this project
              and the improved interface will help Canadian Heritage to
              continue to improve access to online collections. We will work
              with international partners to develop a suitable data model
              based on best practices that will help to enhance the ability to
              search across museum collections. We will then work with Canadian
              museums to promote understanding and use of this model.</li>
              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">Although the original commitment called
              for an expansion, Canadian Heritage is unlikely to be involving
              more partner institutions or adding more data in the coming year,
              given work needed to focus foremost on refining the data model
              and selecting tools.</li>
              <li>The creation of linked open data is a relatively new way of
              publishing data on the web, and standards and tools are still
              being developed. Canadian Heritage will be examining tools that
              are available for harvesting or collecting museum data, but due
              to the foundational work needed to harvest and provide a
              repository for digital collections for museums that currently do
              not have a digital presence, Heritage Canada will not be in a
              position to make progress on this deliverable within the time
              period of the Plan.</li>

            <p>An evaluation of Canadian Heritage’s current projects (e.g., 150
            Years of Canadian Art and the Canadian Heritage Information Network
            Program Linked Data Test Site) has revealed that they need to make
            some adjustments before scaling up to create 5-star data based on
            heritage collections from across Canada.</p>

            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Understanding how well the Government is doing as a whole, or in
            key areas of interest, is challenging because data is presented
            across multiple reports and information sources. Canadians expect
            their government to implement effective and efficient programs and
            services, and to report transparently on whether they are meeting
            their intended goals. A clear understanding of what resources are
            being used by departments to deliver programs and services is
            fundamental to Parliament’s role of holding government accountable
            for delivering on its priorities. Information on planned spending
            and results for government activities is currently provided through
            mandatory departmental reports, including <a href=

            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will increase the transparency of
            government spending and procurement to hold government accountable
            for public expenditures.</p>

            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>As part of the Government of Canada’s new <a href=
            "https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=31300">Policy on
            Results</a>, mandatory departmental reporting is being re-focused
            on each department’s long-term mandates as well as their immediate
            priorities. Related data from planned and actual activities is
            available on a searchable online database that provides quick and
            easy access to detailed information on government spending and
            people management. This data is presented in a manner which
            facilitates Canadians’ analysis and broader understanding of where
            government resources are being invested.

                  </li>
                  <li>Enable users to explore government spending of the most
                  interest to them based on key data elements (e.g., target
                  group, program type, priority area, etc.).</li>

            <p>It will be easier for Canadians to see how government resources
            are being distributed across the areas that interest them. They
            will have greater online access to government financial

                Standing Offers and Supply Arrangements Application</a>.</p>
                <p>The department also introduced increased detail on standing

                Open Contracting Data Standard pilot</a> include the importance
                of linking procurement data from all phases of the procurement
                process (i.e., from requisition to spending on a procurement).
                This serves to provide improved analysis of the contracting
                data flow, increase transparency, and improve cost evaluation
                and traceability across the procurement process by linking
                related procurement data. The linked procurement data, as
                prescribed by the Open Contracting Data Standard pilot, should
                serve as requirements for future implementation of contracting
                systems. We came to the conclusion that any new service or
                procurement system should generate by-default data in Open
                Contracting Data Standard format. Formatting as per Open
                Contracting Data Standard should not be an afterthought.

          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Each year, the Department of Finance Canada plans and prepares
            the federal government’s budget and analyzes economic and fiscal
            developments. This serves to provide policy advice on a wide range
            of economic issues of concern to the health of Canada’s economy.
            The datasets for federal budgets have been released publicly since
            2015 but with a lag time of six to eight weeks given formatting,
            editing and translation requirements. As well, the list of briefing
            note titles prepared on a wide range of economic and other matters
            by Department of Finance officials has only been made available to
            specific requestors through access to information requests.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will provide access to the datasets
            used in the Federal Budget each year in near real time and
            proactively disclose the list of briefing note titles prepared on
            economic and other matters.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>There is an opportunity to accelerate the preparation
            of the datasets used in the Budget. This would allow their
            publication in near real-time following the release of the Budget
            to facilitate analysis by citizens and Parliamentarians. There is
            also an opportunity to broaden public access to the titles of
            briefing notes prepared by Department of Finance officials for the
            Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Deputy Minister, in
            order to be transparent about the issues raised.

          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Each year, the Government of Canada provides funding to support
            initiatives focused on career development, employment,
            homelessness, seniors, youth, and others through its various grants
            and contributions programs. Disbursing these funds works to meet
            the objectives of the Government and ultimately helps to better
            serve Canadians. Reporting on grants and contributions by
            departments is currently asymmetrical, with limited capacity to
            search reports across government. Furthermore, data is currently
            only required for grants and contributions with a funding amount in
            excess of $25,000. Data published across government is in
            non-standard formats, thus making it more difficult to share.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will provide one-stop access to
            consistent, standardized searchable data on grants and
            contributions programs across the federal government.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>Federal departments and agencies with the authority to
            deliver grants and contributions funding are currently disclosing
            data on agreements in excess of $25,000 in order to foster greater
            transparency and openness. To further support the Government’s
            commitment to transparency and openness, information on agreements
            less than $25,000 will be disclosed voluntarily by departments, and
            information published will be standardized and consistent across
            government departments and agencies, improving the quality of the
            data, and allowing for increased searchability.

              <p>The efforts undertaken as part of this commitment have led to
              quite a bit of recognition of the Office of the Comptroller
              General’s work at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.
              Specifically, its story of co-creation and co-development is
              being shared, and its approach is being more broadly adopted
              across the government. To assist with this, the Office of the
              Comptroller General is developing a ‘What We Heard’ report, which
              will provide information on its process, consultation, the work
              undertaken.</p>
              <p>The work undertaken to develop a new, common reporting
              template has also allowed a collaborative process of developing
              guidance, which will also be made publicly available. This
              guidance was developed in consultation with 32 departments to
              ensure it works for everyone, and it is a built in component of
              the reporting standard. This will be made public as part of the
              Guideline &amp; Reporting Standard, to ensure the public
              understands exactly what is being reported on.</p>

          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Currently, business identity information is distributed across
            jurisdictions in Canada, which poses access challenges for citizens
            and businesses alike. The federal, provincial, and territorial
            governments have agreed to collaborate on enhancing processes to
            reduce the burden on corporate registration and reporting and to
            provide streamlined access to corporate information through an
            online search. Making information about Canadian companies and
            organizations more accessible, discoverable, and usable, can
            ultimately improve corporate accountability.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will provide searchable information on
            Canadian businesses that is held in business registries at the
            federal, provincial, and territorial level.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>
            <p>The federal, provincial and territorial members of the Canadian
            Association of Corporate Law Administrators (CACLA) are
            collaborating on the development of an expandable and adaptable
            digital solution.</p>

        Federal Committee on Geomatics and Earth Observations</a> (FCGEO)
        supporting the <a href=
        "http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geomatics/canadas-spatial-data-infrastructure/geospatial-communities/federal">
        Federal Geospatial Platform</a> (FGP)</p>
        <section>
          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Over the last five years, federal departments have worked
            together to establish a single platform to collect and share
            geospatial data. This effort enables Canadians to more easily
            discover, view, and understand geospatial data. Building on this
            strong foundation, the focus in the coming years will be to
            increase the quality and usability of geospatial data to derive
            additional information, solve problems, help with context setting,
            and assist with evidence-based decision-making.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will make more high-quality,
            authoritative, and useable geospatial data available in open
            formats to support better services to Canadians.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>
            <p>The geospatial data collection is being expanded, and the
            technologies to access that data are being improved, thereby
            fundamentally changing the way geospatial assets can be accessed
            and used by government and the public. The single window to federal
            geospatial data, open maps, is supporting progress towards a
            modern, networked, and tech-enabled society. It will ensure
            effective program delivery, improve services to Canadians, and
            support them in their day-to-day activities.</p>

          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Scientific research and data that have been produced by the
            Government of Canada are often difficult for citizens to access.
            The Government of Canada undertakes a wide range of scientific
            activities, making significant investments in scientific research
            and knowledge creation that are essential for informing policy
            choices or decision making, providing services to Canadians, and
            ultimately supporting sustainable economic growth. At the same
            time, the Government highlighted its commitment to ensuring that
            government science is fully available to the public, consistent
            with its broader pledge for openness and transparency.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will take appropriate steps to make the
            science performed in support of Government of Canada programs and
            decision-making open and transparent to Canadians.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>Horizontal implementation of the federal open science
            initiative began in 2012. Under the Third Biennial Plan to the OGP,
            the Government of Canada is building on past work by taking bold
            steps to make government-funded science open and transparent to
            Canadians. Reflecting the importance of citizen engagement and
            collaboration, deliverables are focused on increasing the
            accessibility of government science, helping to ensure Canadians
            are informed of opportunities to engage in federal science and
            technology (S&amp;T) activities, and exploring ways to enhance the
            impact of government data and information.<br>
            Underscoring the Government’s commitment to open science at the
            meeting of G7 Science and Technology Ministers in 2016, Canada
            supported a recommendation to establish an international working
            group on open science. This group is focused on sharing open
            science policies, exploring supportive incentive structures, and
            identifying good practices for promoting increased access to the
            results of publicly funded research, including scientific data and
            publications.

            <h3>Relevance to OGP values</h3>
            <p>This commitment relates to the OGP values of transparency and
            public accountability.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>As governments at all levels continue to make more and more open
            data available to the public, it will be important to help support
            the private sector in extracting knowledge and value from that data
            to build their businesses. In order to develop new products, retain
            talent, and achieve prosperity, competitiveness, and productivity
            for Canada, the Open Data Exchange (ODX) was established in 2015 as
            a partnership among the private, public, and academic sectors to
            support the commercialization of open data by Canadian
            companies.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will partner with the private sector to
            better understand how companies are using open data, and raise
            awareness of the possibilities that exist for Canadian
            entrepreneurs to take advantage of the value of open data.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>The Open Data Exchange is taking advantage of key
            opportunities to work collaboratively with stakeholders at all
            levels to increase the number of open data companies in Canada and
            to explore new methods for improving access and extracting value
            from open data.

          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Currently, Canadians cannot easily find, compare or reuse data
            across Canadian jurisdictions. Governments at the federal,
            provincial, territorial, and municipal levels have varying levels
            of open data implementation. While some governments have launched
            open data portals and made numerous datasets available, others do
            not have official open data or open government policies or
            initiatives. Furthermore, governments set priorities for different
            types of data for release, which may make it difficult for
            Canadians to compare data across jurisdictions. Each government may
            also measure and record data differently, which can make it
            difficult to compare data even when that data is open. The true
            value of open data can really be unlocked when similar, high-value
            data is released using consistent, standardized approaches, so that
            Canadians can easily compare data among departments, across
            geographic locations, and over time.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will expand collaboration with
            provincial, territorial, and municipal partners on further
            standardizing and harmonizing the delivery of open government data
            across jurisdictions.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>Collaborative efforts to implement open government at
            all levels of government began in 2012. Building on past
            pan-Canadian cooperation, the Government of Canada is working with
            other levels of government and key stakeholders to expand
            collaboration across jurisdictions and develop a list of high-value
            datasets that are priorities for governments to release. This work
            will help increase the comprehensiveness of open data available to
            Canadians and encourage comparability of data across different
            governments. In addition, it will work with one or more provincial
            partners to collaborate on a pilot project that will allow users to
            search data from multiple governments via a common portal. This
            pilot project will provide an opportunity to accelerate data
            standardization efforts and better understand the challenges and
            opportunities associated with federated search.

                municipalities. This toolkit is aimed at accelerating the
                implementation open data across Canada. The toolkit provides
                comprehensive guidelines and a step-by-step process to enable

        <section>
          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada remains committed to improving the
            transparency and accountability of the Canadian extractives sector.
            In its second Action Plan, legislation was introduced, the
            Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act (ESTMA), which
            established new reporting and transparency obligations for the
            Canadian extractive sector to contribute to global efforts against
            corruption in the extractive sector.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will implement the Extractive Sector
            Transparency Measures Act (ESTMA) that requires the reporting of
            certain payments made to governments related to the commercial
            development of oil, gas, and minerals.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>Canada’s extractive sector has a well-established
            financial reporting system, which ensures transparency and the good
            governance of natural resource revenues. Implementation of the
            ESTMA is helping to improve the transparency of payments made by
            extractive companies involved in the exploration and/or extraction
            of oil, gas, or minerals to all levels of government, both foreign
            and domestic. The new reporting system complements existing
            reporting requirements with a view to ensuring Canada’s framework
            is aligned with other G7 countries and is consistent with the
            emerging global standard.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Relevance to OGP values</h3>
            <p>This commitment relates to transparency, civic participation and
            accountability.</p>

          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Citizens of all nations can benefit both socially and
            economically from open government, regardless of who they are or
            where they live, but it is often harder for developing countries to
            access the cutting-edge digital resources or support the
            professional training and awareness programs that can enable open
            government initiatives. To ensure that the global open government
            movement is not restricted to the wealthiest or most
            technologically advanced governments, Canada continues to support
            peer knowledge exchange and capacity-building efforts.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will work with international partners
            to increase the transparency of international development funding,
            and to share skills and knowledge with developing countries to
            ensure that everyone can reap the benefits of open government.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>
            <p>Under Canada’s first two Action Plans, steps were taken to
            ensure greater transparency and quality of Canada’s international
            aid data. Canada worked with partners in the Open Data for
            Development (OD4D) network to build capacity around the world for
            ambitious open government initiatives to benefit citizens. By
            expanding these initiatives, and undertaking new leadership roles
            in support of the Open Government Partnership and the International
            Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), Canada can help ensure citizens
            around the world have access to government information and
            opportunities to engage in public affairs. This will also
            facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its
            Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

            <h3>Relevance to OGP values</h3>

              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">
                <p>Canada has been a vocal, visible, and active global leader
                in open government issues – and in the OGP in particular – for
                a number of years. Canada first joined the OGP in 2012, and has
                been a member in good standing since that time. Canada was
                recently elected to join the Open Government Partnership
                Steering Committee, and will officially become a member of the
                Steering Committee in fall 2017. Canada will continue to
                promote the important linkages between the OGP and the 2030
                Agenda for Sustainable Development, exploring how the OGP can
                help countries meet their commitments to effectively implement
                and report on the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
                <p>In addition to the principles of the Joint Declaration on
                Open Government for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for
                Sustainable Development, Canada has embraced other
                principles-based open government initiatives, including taking
                a leading role in the international Open Data Charter. Canada
                remains committed to the principles of the Joint Declaration,
                and will seek to ensure that all progress on domestic and
                international implementation of the Sustainable Development
                Goals is supported by meaningful engagement with stakeholders
                within and outside government, and that this progress is
                reported publicly to ensure strengthened accountability and
                greater openness.</p>

                <p>At the World Humanitarian Summit, signatories of the Grand
                Bargain agreed to use the IATI standard to enhance transparency
                (Istanbul, May 2016). The Global Partnership for Effective
                Development Cooperation endorsed IATI as an open data standard
                for development cooperation in the outcome document of its
                Second High-Level Meeting (Nairobi, December 2016).</p>

                <p>IATI hosted a Technical Working Group meeting in Tanzania

                (including government officials, civil society, media) were
                discussed with a view to improve the IATI data standard and
                tools. Improvements have been made since to the <a href=

          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>The participation of both civil society and government is
            essential to the success of any open government initiative. On the
            recommendation of the Open Government Partnership, the Government
            of Canada will establish a permanent mechanism for improving
            meaningful public dialogue, to move beyond informing and consulting
            to enhanced citizen collaboration and empowerment.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will create ongoing mechanisms for
            strengthening dialogue with civil society in support of open
            government activities.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>Canada initially established a multi-stakeholder
            advisory panel to support development and implementation of
            Canada’s first two Action Plans. Canada is committed to cultivating
            an effective relationship with civil society by designing and
            nurturing a renewed mechanism to support constructive, ongoing
            dialogue between government and non-government stakeholders. Led by
            the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, this renewed mechanism
            will establish a strong link between government and civil society.
            It will engage regularly to track progress on Canada’s commitments,
            identify potential new areas of focus, and help raise awareness of
            open government issues across Canada.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Relevance to OGP values</h3>
            <p>This commitment relates to the OGP values of transparency, civic
            participation and public accountability.</p>
          </section>

              <li class="mrgn-bttm-md">Develop and maintain a renewed mechanism
              for ongoing, meaningful dialogue between the Government of Canada

          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Expected result</h3>
            <p>Civil society will be able to access a formal mechanism for
            regular, two-way conversation on open government issues with the
            federal government.</p>

          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Public engagement through open dialogue and participatory
            processes is vital to the success of government. The Government of
            Canada recognizes that informed decision making requires the
            knowledge, views, values and skills of experts, stakeholders, and
            citizens to inform and shape effective government policies,
            programs, and services. Consultation provides participants an
            opportunity to state how an issue affects them, identify underlying
            values and contribute to shared outcomes.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will foster enhanced citizen
            participation through greater collaboration and co-creation with
            the public and stakeholders within and across government
            initiatives.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>Through this open dialogue commitment, the Government
            will engage citizens, stakeholders, and other governments, to
            participate in well-designed processes that create space for
            deliberation and collaboration of the participants involved. The
            Government of Canada will adopt common principles, clarify needs
            and implement tools and guidance to foster greater collaboration
            across traditional organizational boundaries.

          <h2>Commitment description</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Public engagement through open dialogue and participatory
            processes is vital to the success of government. The Government of
            Canada recognizes that informed decision making requires the
            knowledge, views, values and skills of experts, stakeholders, and
            citizens to inform and shape effective government policies,
            programs, and services. Consultation provides participants an
            opportunity to state how an issue affects them, identify underlying
            values and contribute to shared outcomes.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will foster enhanced citizen
            participation through greater collaboration and co-creation with
            the public and stakeholders within and across government
            initiatives.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>Through this open dialogue commitment, the Government
            will engage citizens, stakeholders, and other governments, to
            participate in well-designed processes that create space for
            deliberation and collaboration of the participants involved. The
            Government of Canada will adopt common principles, clarify needs
            and implement tools and guidance to foster greater collaboration
            across traditional organizational boundaries.

              to collaborate on developing a performance measurement framework
              for open government, with clear indicators that could be

            <h3>What is the public problem that the commitment will
            address?</h3>
            <p>Service excellence is a top priority for the Canada Revenue
            Agency, and the agency is committed to ensuring high-quality
            services are delivered to Canadians in a way that makes them feel
            respected and valued.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is the commitment?</h3>
            <p>The Government of Canada will undertake public consultations and
            engagement to support improved access to high-value, statistical
            tax data and publications, increased fairness of the rules
            governing charities’ political activities, and better understanding
            of factors affecting the low rates of benefit uptake.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>How will the commitment contribute to solve the public
            problem?</h3>
            <p>The Canada Revenue Agency is undertaking a number of key public
            consultation and engagement activities to respond to key
            challenges:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Canada Revenue Agency currently publishes open data in
              various categories both on its website and on Canada’s Open Data
              portal. A better understanding of the public’s satisfaction with,
              and interest in, statistical tax publications and related data,

                Challenges
              </summary>
              <p>It’s sometimes challenging for us to align with international
              standards because definitions vary. For example, foreign
              governments use “grants” and “contracts”, while the Government of
              Canada uses “Grants”, “Contributions”, “Other Transfer Payments”,
              and “Procurement Contracts”, all as similar mechanisms. We would
              love to hear from you if you have ideas on how we may be able to
              better address this challenge.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Launch a pilot project to provide citizens and business
                with online capacity to search existing federal and provincial
                (from Ontario, Québec, and Nova Scotia) business registries
                through a single search tool.</li>
                <li>Develop a proof of concept and prototype of a digital
                solution for reducing burden in the areas of corporate search,
                registration, and reporting for Canadian businesses that is
                expandable to all registries across Canada in order to drive
                consistency in corporate data provided to the public by both
                federal and provincial governments.</li>

                a multi-jurisdictional access service.</li>
                <li>From November&nbsp; 2016 to March 2017, a prototype was
                developed using datasets from eight registries (federal,

                <p>Developing departmental OGIPs was a useful and productive
                exercise for the Government of Canada. They were a much-needed
                first step and have helped departments organize and allocate
                resources and prioritize activities. A key lesson from the OGIP
                process has been the necessity to limit the burden for
                departments by focusing on key information required by
                developing accessible templates to facilitate the release of
                the Plans. As the Government of Canada has now launched its new

                potential value of open government data. In future,
                consideration should be given to potential open data engagement
                activities that allow developers to tackle particular policy
                challenges or problems facing Canadians.</p>

                <h2 class="h4">Developing new tools and applications that use
                government data – ODX has:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Established a mentorship and concierge service to work
                  directly with companies to help them either gain access to
                  open data or architect systems to process open data;</li>
                  <li>Run workshops to improve participants' open data and
                  analytical skills; and</li>
                  <li>Developed the <a href="http://codx.ca/odx-ventures/">ODX
                  Ventures</a> program that will provide assistance to
                  companies on a project-by-project basis to build open data
                  powered products and services.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="h4">Establishing a framework for open data
                standards</h2>
                <p>Open data standards remain a challenge with data providers
                and data users. As such, ODX has been developing a stronger
                working relationship with data providers at all levels of
                government and advocating working towards, at minimum, common
                file formats to ease ingestion of data from different
                government sources. As market sectors mature, ODX anticipates
                that open data standards will emerge to fit the needs of the
                applications as is already evident with environmental and
                geospatial data. In the interim, ODX will continue to work with
                its partner, ThinkData Works, to allow companies to access open
                data sources through a common application programming interface
                (API).</p>
                <h2 class="h4">Consulting with industry champions on
                demonstration projects:</h2>
                <p>ODX has convened an Advisory Board, that is predominantly
                private-sector-led, to provide input into ODX strategy and to
                advise on trends and opportunities in open data. ODX has also
                launched the first two of three planned demonstration projects.
                The first project focuses on the digitization of provincial
                education standards, with D2L as the private sector lead. The
                second is working with the City of Guelph on an open data
                challenge to engage the private sector to create solutions to
                civic challenges such as energy efficiency, water quality, and
                improved management of parking resources. The latter has
                garnered much attention from other municipalities across Canada
                and ODX is evaluating the opportunity to productize the
                offering.</p>
                <h2 class="h4">Launching a national outreach program</h2>
                <p>ODX has launched its national outreach program, which
                includes several initiatives to connect with creators of and
                users of open data across the country, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Launching the Open Data 150 (OD150) project, to identify
                  companies using open data and how they have integrated open
                  data into their business models. Moreover, ODX will use the
                  OD150 to connect companies to market opportunities, an
                  instance of which has already come to fruition with the
                  second demonstration project involving the City of Guelph
                  Civic Challenge;</li>
                  <li>Partnering on the Open Cities Index, which ranks cities
                  on their degree of openness, and,</li>
                  <li>Launching the ODX Connect program in partnership with the
                  Canadian Digital Media Network to help open data enabled
                  companies go global by helping them enter new markets.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="h4">Incubating new data-driven companies</h2>
                <p>Given the early nature of the open data ecosystem in Canada,
                ODX spent its first year laying the necessary groundwork to
                support open-data start-ups. Formalized collaboration
                agreements founding partners and several third party partners
                are in place to launch projects or provide access to value add
                resources for new companies. As an example, ThinkData Works
                provides the open data search functionality on the ODX
                website.</p>
                <p>ODX has connected with many companies through its
                concierge/mentor program, the OD150, demonstration projects and
                skills development programming. In an effort to further
                accelerate the creation and evolution of open data driven
                business models, ODX is further engaging with companies via the
                ODX Connect program. Through these programs, ODX has been
                incubating companies over the majority of its first year of
                existence. As these programs mature, there will be an
                opportunity to dig deeper into open data market needs and work
                with even more companies.</p>

                <p>Canada's Open Data Exchange was funded through the 2014

                been made and ODX is on track to deliver against its stated
                goals at the end of the three-year mandate.</p>

                significantly expanded due to enhanced capacity and resources,
                and will continue to grow past into the next action plan cycle.
                As was reported in the last update, four hubs are in full
                operation, including the <a href=
                "http://www.idatosabiertos.org/">Latin America Open Data
                Initiative (ILDA)</a>, Open Data in East Europe and Central

                "http://www.caribbeanopeninstitute.org/">Caribbean Open
                Institute (COI)</a>, and the Open Data Lab Jakarta in Asia.
                Building on existing open data work in Africa, plans are
                underway to launch the African Open Data hub for October 2016.
                The OD4D Network has provided technical support to at least 7
                countries, including Burkina Faso, Tanzania, Peru and
                Jamaica.</p>
                <p>Funds provided under the OD4D initiative have also supported
                a number of additional activities around the world,
                including:</p>
                <ul>

                  <a href="http://opendatacharter.net/">Open Data Charter</a>;
                  </li>
                  <li>Creation of a Leaders Network of Open Data Advocates to
                  support the development and implementation of open data
                  policies;</li>
                  <li>Development of 7 studies on good practices and support
                  for open data applications in health, agriculture, cities,
                  parliaments and education;</li>
                  <li>Continued Development of the <a href=
                  "http://opendataenterprise.org/map">Open Data Impact Map</a>,
                  a database with more than 2000 uses of open data.
                  </li>
                  <li>OD4D is also supporting the development of international
                  standards for open data, and is funding the development of
                  "sector packages" for the International Open Data
                  Charter.</li>

                <p>OD4D made some inroads into connecting with various Canadian
                open data communities at the <a href=

                Conference</a>, at the 2016 Open Data Day and at other

                <p>Successful capacity building in open data takes time. In
                regions where OD4D have been operating for longer periods, such
                as Latin America, significant strides have been made in terms
                of implementing open data initiatives, and realizing the
                benefit of those initiatives for socioeconomic development (as
                measured by the Open Data Barometer) and in creating successful
                innovations.</p>
                <p>Issues with capacity can slow down planned initiatives – for
                example, limited partner capacity delayed the implementation of
                the planned African Open Data hub for nearly a year. The hub,
                which will build on the prior activities conducted in Africa,
                will help to better coordinate funding and ensure support for
                both governments and civil society in creating and using open
                data.</p>
                <p>Focusing on enabling the use of open data in sectoral
                initiatives and innovations (and their enabling environments)
                can help to realize significant socio-economic development.
                However, high level open data initiatives remain a crucial part
                of the implementation process.</p>
                <p>Assessing and benchmarking the impact of open data
                initiatives around the world will remain crucial for assessing
                the efficacy and quality of such initiatives in both Canada and
                the world. Beyond 2016, OD4D hopes to ensure that benchmarking
                activities such as the Open Data Barometer and Open Data Impact
                map can cross-reference to create a fuller picture of supply
                and demand for open data initiatives.</p>
                <p>Sustainable funding for open data initiatives is crucial to
                ensure the ongoing impact of open data.</p>

                Observations (FCGEO), a committee of senior executives from 21
                departments and agencies that are producers and/or consumers of

                  <li>Makes geospatial information available in a coherent way
                  through open government's <a href="[site:url]/open-maps">Open
                  Maps</a> portal. Hundreds of geospatial datasets are
                  available on Open Maps to the public to conduct research or
                  produce value-added products and applications, driving
                  innovation and stimulating economic development. Many of the
                  datasets can also be layered together and viewed as a map,
                  providing instant insights and opportunities for
                  location-based analysis of information. The number of
                  available datasets on Open Maps continues to grow as more
                  federal departments are onboarded into the FGP;
                  </li>
                  <li>Provides a collaborative space for federal departments to
                  not only access data but to share a common application
                  development framework to enable reusable mapping tools. FGP
                  has made over 130 ArcGIS Online licences available to federal
                  users with plans to further expand participation in the FGP
                  collaborative mapping environment as the FGP moves into
                  post-project operations; and</li>
                  <li>Provides an efficient process to allow departments to
                  easily onboard into the FGP Catalogue to make data and
                  services available to both the federal community and the
                  public (via Open Maps). The FGP Data Dissemination Repository

                  <li>Brain training requires a significant time commitment.
                  The two primary barriers to engagement in the training were
                  motivation and incentive.</li>
                  <li>In online learning games, players play on their own terms
                  and may stop playing when they think they have obtained what
                  they want from the game.</li>
                  <li>Lower income groups may be excluded from these kinds of
                  learning activity if they are required to pay user fees.
                  Along with other barriers, this could create a new sort of
                  digital divide. It was recommended that training should be
                  free and easily accessible to all (as it was in this
                  project).&nbsp; Blended learning was identified as a good
                  practice with other supports (such as mentors) provided to

                  person within each workplace to be a Workplace Coach, who
                  would support their co-workers as they participate in the
                  digital training.</li>

                <p>In 2014, the Information and Privacy Policy Division
                launched a Director General Steering Committee on the
                Modernized Vision for the ATIP Training program. The proposed
                vision aimed to develop a coherent, cost-effective
                government-wide approach to ATIP training that would reduce
                duplication and redundancies in financial, human and material
                resources amongst institutions.</p>
                <p>The Steering Committee established six priority ATIP
                training areas. These priority areas were:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Privacy Impact Assessments;</li>
                  <li>Privacy Breach prevention, management and reporting;</li>
                  <li>ATIP Awareness training for the executive cadre within
                  government;</li>
                  <li>Cabinet Confidences and the revised consultation
                  process;</li>
                  <li>Most Frequently Invoked Exemptions; and</li>
                  <li>ATIP General Awareness.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A collaborative approach was taken where a number of
                departments took the lead to develop training components for
                each of these priorities. The components were to be implemented
                in a phased approach that would serve as an overarching ATIP
                awareness strategy that spans government-wide.</p>

                Fundamentals; Access to Information in the Government of Canada
                and Privacy in the Government of Canada). In addition, the

                Impact Assessments online module which is currently offered to
                a few departments. The training modules for the remaining three
                priority areas are in various stages of completion.</p>
                <p>Institutions will continue to collaborate to move this work
                forward when additional resources are made available during
                2016 to 2018, including completing training modules for the
                three priority areas as well as integrating all training
                modules into one overarching ATIP awareness program.</p>

                <p>The current pilot has reached its maximum capacity with 33
                institutions using the service. The pilot demonstrated the
                feasibility of an online channel for receiving ATIP requests.
                The Government of Canada announced in Budget 2016 that it would
                make it easier for Canadians to access government information,
                including their personal information, by creating a simple,
                central website where Canadians can submit requests to any
                government institution. Work to develop the website has been
                initiated. The first phase of roll-out is targeted for
                2018.</p>
                <p>One key best practice that led to the success of completing
                this action item was the early and regular engagement with
                institutions in order to support them in meeting their posting
                requirements.</p>
                <p>The <a href=

                project was a valuable approach to test the feasibility of an
                online channel for receiving ATIP requests. <u></u></p>
                <p>The key lesson learned was the importance of dedicating
                resources to provide ongoing support and coordination for
                horizontal initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

                public federal consultations of interest to them. Key features

                hosted by MaRS, on June 26, 2015 in Toronto, ON where the GC
                received input and design prototypes on an online consultation
                portal from designers, programmers, other government reps and
                civil society. Prototypes and artefacts from this event will be

                (OGIP) that describes the planned activities to meet the
                requirements of the Directive, including the development of
                data and information inventories.</p>
                <p>A total of 56 OGIPs were submitted to TBS and are being

                <p>Developing departmental OGIPs was a useful and productive
                exercise for the Government of Canada. They were a much-needed
                first step and have helped departments organize and allocate
                resources and prioritize activities. A key lesson from the OGIP
                process has been the necessity to limit the burden for
                departments by focusing on key information required by
                developing accessible templates to facilitate the release of
                the Plans. As the Government of Canada has now launched its new
                Biennial Action Plan (2016-18) which outlines a broader and
                more ambitious vision, we will be revisiting these plans and
                accelerating timelines, focus and reporting requirements where
                required to better reflect this new vision.</p>

                (ODX</a>), located in Waterloo, Ontario.</p>
                <p>ODX’s website was developed and launched (<a href=

                supplying and requesting open data. In collaboration with FedDev,
                ODX also undertook numerous demonstration projects in an effort to
                support the selection of promising companies for incubation.
                Funding for ODX was identified through a non-repayable contribution
                under FedDev Ontario’s Investing in Commercialization Partnerships
                initiative.</p>

                expected to result in the incubation of 15 new data-driven
                companies. However, incubation of these new companies and achieving
                other planned deliverables proved to be more complex than
                anticipated. A strategic decision was made to extend the delivery
                period beyond the planned period; commitments were accordingly
                rolled over to the 2016-18 Open Government Plan.</p>

                significantly expanded due to enhanced capacity and resources, and
                will continue to grow past into the next action plan cycle. As was
                reported in the last update, four hubs are in full operation,
                including the <a href="http://www.idatosabiertos.org/">Latin
                America Open Data Initiative (ILDA)</a>, Open Data in East Europe
                and Central Asia (ODECA), the <a href=
                "http://www.caribbeanopeninstitute.org/">Caribbean Open Institute
                (COI)</a>, and the Open Data Lab Jakarta in Asia. Building on
                existing open data work in Africa, plans are underway to launch the
                African Open Data hub for October 2016. The OD4D Network has
                provided technical support to at least 07 countries, including
                Burkina Faso, Tanzania, Peru and Jamaica.</p>
                <p>Funds provided under the OD4D initiative have also supported a
                number of additional activities around the world, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Launch of the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of the <a href=
                  "http://opendatabarometer.org/">Open Data Barometer</a> in

                  </li>
                  <li>Creation of a Leaders Network of Open Data Advocates to
                  support the development and implementation of open data
                  policies;</li>
                  <li>Development of 7 studies on good practices and support for
                  open data applications in health, agriculture, cities,
                  parliaments and education;</li>

                  Map</a>, a database with more than 2000 uses of open data.

                  <li>OD4D is also supporting the development of international
                  standards for open data, and is funding the development of
                  “sector packages” for the International Open Data Charter.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>OD4D made some inroads into connecting with various Canadian
                open data communities at the International Open Data Conference, at
                the 2016 Open Data Day and at other initiatives across the country.
                OD4D has supported research from OpenNorth and other
                organizations.</p>

                <p>Successful capacity building in open data takes time. In regions
                where OD4D have been operating for longer periods, such as Latin
                America, significant strides have been made in terms of
                implementing open data initiatives, and realizing the benefit of
                those initiatives for socioeconomic development (as measured by the
                Open Data Barometer) and in creating successful innovations.</p>
                <p>Issues with capacity can slow down planned initiatives – for
                example, limited partner capacity delayed the implementation of the
                planned African Open Data hub for nearly a year. The hub, which
                will build on the prior activities conducted in Africa, will help
                to better coordinate funding and ensure support for both
                governments and civil society in creating and using open data.</p>
                <p>Focusing on enabling the use of open data in sectoral
                initiatives and innovations (and their enabling environments) can
                help to realize significant socio-economic development. However,
                high level open data initiatives remain a crucial part of the
                implementation process.</p>
                <p>Assessing and benchmarking the impact of open data initiatives
                around the world will remain crucial for assessing the efficacy and
                quality of such initiatives in both Canada and the world. Beyond
                2016, OD4D hopes to ensure that benchmarking activities such as the
                Open Data Barometer and Open Data Impact map can cross-reference to
                create a fuller picture of supply and demand for open data
                initiatives.</p>
                <p>Sustainable funding for open data initiatives is crucial to
                ensure the ongoing impact of open data.</p>

                Observations (FCGEO), a committee of senior executives from 21
                departments and agencies that are producers and/or consumers of

                  through open government’s <a href="[site:url]/open-maps">Open
                  Maps</a> portal. Hundreds of geospatial datasets are
                  available on Open Maps to the public to conduct research or
                  produce value-added products and applications, driving
                  innovation and stimulating economic development. Many of the
                  datasets can also be layered together and viewed as a map,
                  providing instant insights and opportunities for
                  location-based analysis of information. The number of
                  available datasets on Open Maps continues to grow as more
                  federal departments are onboarded into the FGP;
                  </li>

                  not only access data but to share a common application
                  development framework to enable reusable mapping tools. FGP
                  has made over 130 ArcGIS Online licences available to federal
                  users with plans to further expand participation in the FGP
                  collaborative mapping environment as the FGP moves into
                  post-project operations; and</li>
                  <li>Provides an efficient process to allow departments to
                  easily onboard into the FGP Catalogue to make data and
                  services available to both the federal community and the
                  public (via Open Maps). The FGP Data Dissemination Repository

                  <li>Brain training requires a significant time commitment.
                  The two primary barriers to engagement in the training were
                  motivation and incentive.</li>
                  <li>In online learning games, players play on their own terms
                  and may stop playing when they think they have obtained what
                  they want from the game.</li>

                  learning activity if they are required to pay user fees.
                  Along with other barriers, this could create a new sort of
                  digital divide. It was recommended that training should be
                  free and easily accessible to all (as it was in this
                  project).&nbsp; Blended learning was identified as a good

                information, including their own personal information held by
                government, by creating a simple, central website where
                Canadians can submit requests to any government institution.
                Work to develop the central website has been initiated. The

                Vision aimed to develop a coherent, cost-effective
                government-wide approach to ATIP training that would reduce
                duplication and redundancies in financial, human and material
                resources amongst institutions.</p>

                <p>A collaborative approach was taken where a number of
                departments took the lead to develop training components for
                each of these priorities. The components were to be implemented
                in a phased approach that would serve as an overarching ATIP
                awareness strategy that spans government-wide.</p>
                <p>The Canada School of Public Service currently offers ATIP
                General Awareness courses to employees and courses specific to

                Fundamentals; Access to Information in the Government of Canada
                and Privacy in the Government of Canada). In addition, the
                Department of Fisheries and Oceans completed the ATIP Awareness
                training for Executives and Health Canada completed Privacy
                Impact Assessments online module which is currently offered to
                a few departments. The training modules for the remaining three
                priority areas are in various stages of completion.</p>
                <p>Institutions will continue to collaborate to move this work
                forward when additional resources are made available during
                2016 to 2018, including completing training modules for the
                three priority areas as well as integrating all training
                modules into one overarching ATIP awareness program.</p>

                <p>The current pilot has reached its maximum capacity with 33
                institutions using the service. The pilot demonstrated the
                feasibility of an online channel for receiving ATIP requests.
                The Government of Canada announced in Budget 2016 that it would
                make it easier for Canadians to access government information,
                including their personal information, by creating a simple,
                central website where Canadians can submit requests to any
                government institution. Work to develop the website has been
                initiated. The first phase of roll-out is targeted for2018.</p>
                <p>One key best practice that led to the success of completing
                this action item was the early and regular engagement with
                institutions in order to support them in meeting their posting
                requirements.</p>

                project was a valuable approach to test the feasibility of an
                online channel for receiving ATIP requests. <u></u></p>
                <p>The key lesson learned was the importance of dedicating

                public federal consultations of interest to them. Key features

                portal from designers, programmers, other government reps and
                civil society. Prototypes and artefacts from this event will be
